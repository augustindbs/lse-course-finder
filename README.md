# LSE Undergraduate Course Finder

## Course finding tool based on grade statistics and assessment components.

### Setup

For some reason, Streamlit is not allowing me to deploy the app. To access the tool, clone this repository and install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You will need [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) already installed for this.

<br/>

Once you are inside the directory and have all requirements installed, run `streamlit run app.py`

Data is currently available for departments of Economics, Management, Government, Finance, Mathematics and Statistics.
