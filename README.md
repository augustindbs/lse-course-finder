# LSE Undergraduate Course Finder

## Setup

Course finding tool based on past grade statistics and assessment components for LSE undergraduates.

For some reason, Streamlit is not allowing me to deploy the app. To access the tool, clone this repository and install the requirements using:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You will of course need PIP installed for this.

Once you are inside the directory and have all requirements installed, run:

```streamlit run app.py```
