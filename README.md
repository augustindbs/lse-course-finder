# LSE Undergraduate Course Finder

### Course finding tool based on grade statistics and assessment components

**[Access the app here](https://lse-course-finder.streamlit.app/)**

<br/>

Data is currently available for the **following departments**: 
- Economics
- Management
- Government
- Finance
- Statistics
- Mathematics

The dataset excludes courses that are no longer taught as of today (even though due to resits there may be present-day course data for these in the LSE exam statistics), and does not include new courses for which examinations have not yet taken place. 

<br/>

Can now browse and filter courses based on relevant metrics (coursework components, mean grade, first-class rate etc)
