# LSE Undergraduate Course Finder

### Course finding tool based on grade statistics and assessment components

**[Access the app here](https://lse-course-finder.streamlit.app/)**

<br/>

Data is currently available for the **following departments**: 
- Economics
- Management
- Government
- Finance
- International Relations
- Mathematics

The dataset excludes courses that are no longer taught as of today (even though due to resits there may be present-day course data for these in the LSE exam statistics), and does not include new courses for which examinations have not yet taken place. 

<br/>

Exams that are **held on campus** (whether on paper or e-Exam format) are considered as such. Take-home exams, essays, dissertations, problem sets, class presentations or anything done at home are **considered coursework**.

<br/>

There is also the option to **browse, sort and filter courses based on relevant metrics** (unit value, mean grade, first-class rate etc.), as well as **search for courses by keywords** in the course content or course name.
