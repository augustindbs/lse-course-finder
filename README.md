# LSE Undergraduate Course Finder

## Course finding tool based on grade statistics and assessment components

### Setup

For some reason, Streamlit is not allowing me to deploy the app. To access the tool, clone this repository and install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You will need [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) already installed for this.

<br/>

Once you are inside the directory and have all requirements installed, run `streamlit run app.py`

</br>

### General Information

Data is currently available for the **following departments**: 
- Economics
- Management
- Government
- Finance
- Statistics
- Mathematics

The dataset excludes courses that are no longer taught as of today (even though due to resits there may be present-day course data for these in the LSE exam statistics), and does not include new courses for which examinations have not yet taken place.
